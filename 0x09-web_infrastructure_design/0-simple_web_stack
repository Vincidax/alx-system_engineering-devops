One Server Web Infrastructure

User

The user enters www.foobar.com into their web browser.
The web browser uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to lookup the IP address for www.foobar.com.
The DNS returns the IP address 8.8.8.8, which is the IP address of the server hosting www.foobar.com.
The web browser establishes a connection to the server at 8.8.8.8.

Server

The web server on the server receives the connection request from the user's web browser.
The web server identifies the requested website, www.foobar.com.
The web server retrieves the application files for www.foobar.com from the server's disk drive.
The web server processes the application files and generates a response.
The web server sends the response back to the user's web browser.

Application Server

The application server is responsible for executing the application code for www.foobar.com. This code may be written in a variety of programming languages, such as PHP, Python, or Ruby.

Database

The database is used to store data for www.foobar.com, such as user accounts, product information, and blog posts.

Domain Name

A domain name is a unique identifier for a website on the internet. It is what users type into their web browsers to visit a website.

DNS Record

A DNS record is a database entry that maps a domain name to an IP address. This allows web browsers to find the correct server for a given website.

www Record

A www record is a type of DNS record that maps the www subdomain of a domain name to an IP address. This allows users to visit a website by typing www.domain.com or simply domain.com.

Web Server

A web server is a software application that listens for HTTP requests from web browsers and delivers the requested content. Nginx is a popular web server that is known for its speed and efficiency.

Application Server

An application server is a software application that executes application code and provides services to applications, such as database access and session management.

Database

A database is a software application that stores and organizes data. MySQL is a popular open-source database that is used by many websites.

Communication with User's Computer

The server uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with the user's computer. HTTP is a standard protocol for transferring data between web servers and web browsers.

Issues with This Infrastructure

SPOF

This infrastructure has a single point of failure (SPOF), which is the server. If the server goes down, the website will be unavailable.

Downtime When Maintenance Needed

If maintenance is needed on the server, such as deploying new code, the website will be unavailable during the maintenance period.

Cannot Scale If Too Much Incoming Traffic

If the website receives too much incoming traffic, the server may not be able to handle the load. This can result in slow performance or even outages.

Mitigation Strategies

There are a number of strategies that can be used to mitigate the issues with this infrastructure:

SPOF: To mitigate the risk of a SPOF, multiple servers can be used in a load balancing configuration. This will distribute traffic across multiple servers and improve the availability of the website.
Downtime When Maintenance Needed: To reduce downtime when maintenance is needed, a blue-green deployment strategy can be used. This involves deploying the new code to a separate server and then switching traffic over to the new server once the deployment is complete.
Cannot Scale If Too Much Incoming Traffic: To scale the infrastructure to handle more incoming traffic, multiple servers can be used in a load balancing configuration. Additionally, a content delivery network (CDN) can be used to cache static content and deliver it to users from servers that are closer to them.
