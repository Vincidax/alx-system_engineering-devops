0x0C. Web server

In this directory, I explore the working mechanism of web server by doing
projects provided  by ALX

0. Transfer a file to your server
	0-transfer_file

	a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server

1. Install nginx web server
	1-install_nginx_web_server

Requirements:

Install nginx on your web-01
server
Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
You canâ€™t use systemctl for restarting nginx

2. Setup a domain name
	2-setup_a_domain_name


3. Redirection
